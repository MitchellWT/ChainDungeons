# ChainDungeons

All the unity scripts used in Chain Dungeons. This game was developed during the GMTK Game Jam 2021 which is a game jam with a 48 hour time constraint. Due to this constrain the code was not initally commenting and the quality is debatable. I've have added commenting and my takeaways for my own reflection and correction. Key takeaway: I was calling unity find methods multiple times instead of just storing the object in the script class.
