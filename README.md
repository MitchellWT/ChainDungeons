# ChainDungeons

All the unity scripts used in Chain Dungeons. This game was developed during the GMTK Game Jam 2021 which is a game jam with a 48 hour time constraint. Due to this constrain the code does not have any commenting and the quality is debatable. I hope to add commenting and review my coding in order to better understand my coding habits under pressure, as resolve negative habits.

The game can be viewed and dowloaded at: https://ductedheating.itch.io/chain-dungeons.
